/**
 * Runtime-error transport to the embedding Cowork host.
 *
 * This is the ONLY module that posts a runtime-error signal to the parent
 * frame. It sends a fixed, zero-argument, detail-free message so no dynamic
 * error data (name / message / stack / component stack / route / URL / token /
 * app id / customer content) ever crosses the parent-frame boundary. The
 * Cowork host owns the localized, user-facing crash UI.
 *
 * Security posture (do not weaken):
 *   - No wildcard (`"*"`) target origin. Each fixed message is posted to every
 *     known Cowork host origin; only the origin that matches the actual
 *     embedding parent delivers, and Cowork additionally pins `event.source`
 *     to this iframe before acting on it.
 *   - No inferred-origin logic (no `ancestorOrigins`, `document.referrer`,
 *     or `location.origin` fallback). If the embedding host origin is not in
 *     the allow-list below, the preview degrades gracefully to its in-frame
 *     fallback and simply does not raise the host-level generic crash UI.
 *   - No general-purpose "post to parent" API. Every other purpose-built
 *     signal lives in its own dedicated sibling file and imports
 *     `COWORK_PARENT_ORIGINS` from here rather than duplicating it: the
 *     app-mounted first-paint signal (`app-mounted-transport.ts`) and the
 *     bounded app-view snapshot (`app-view-transport.ts`). The general
 *     console-forwarding channel remains console-capture.ts's own legacy,
 *     runtime-derived-origin path — do not route new purpose-built signals
 *     through it.

/**
 * Explicit allow-list of Cowork host origins the preview may signal.
 *
 * Keep this in sync with Cowork's supported host origins. Adding a new host
 * origin is the ONLY expected change to this file. Never add `"*"`, a suffix
 * match, or a runtime-derived origin.
 *
 * Exported so every purpose-built parent-frame transport — `app-mounted-transport.ts`
 * (the third channel, app-studio#2979 P1) and `app-view-transport.ts` (the
 * fourth, app vision) — broadcasts to the identical audited list instead of
 * maintaining a second, driftable copy. AGENTS.md's LOCKED section lists them.
